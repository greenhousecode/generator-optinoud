# Optinoud Yeoman generator

Generate an Optinoud instance wherever you like.

Optinoud lets you write ES6+ and SASS snippets, while transpiling to ES5+CSS, and live injecting it into a specified website.

## Prerequisites

You need to have Optinoud globally installed. Run once:

```shell
npm install -g generator-optinoud
```

## How to use

Open a Terminal window and navigate to the folder where you want to generate an Optinoud setup:

```shell
cd /path/to/folder
```

Then initiate Optinoud through `npx`, and follow the steps:

```shell
npx yo optinoud
```
